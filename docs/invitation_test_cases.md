# Invitation Module - Test Cases and Requirements

This document outlines the basic requirements and comprehensive test cases for the invitation module. Invitation management is exposed via FastAPI endpoints in `app/api/v1/endpoints/invitation.py` and the data model defined in `app/schema/invitation.py`.

## Basic Requirements

1. **Create Invitation**
   - Accept name, email, `restaurantId`, `managerId`, and `roleId`.
   - Persist the invitation and set an expiration date (default TTL of 7 days).
   - Return the saved document in API responses.
2. **Delete Invitation**
   - Allow removing an invitation by its ID.
   - Return `True` on success or HTTP 404 if the invitation does not exist.
3. **User Invitations Retrieval**
   - Fetch all invitations for a given email address.
   - Return an empty list when no invitations are found.
4. **Validation and Error Handling**
   - Ensure email addresses are valid and all required fields are present.
   - Handle database or service errors gracefully with HTTP 500 and a detailed message.

## Test Cases

### 1. Create Invitation Endpoint `/api/v1/invitations/`
- **TC1.1** Valid payload returns the saved invitation document with an ID and `expire_at` timestamp.
- **TC1.2** Missing required fields (e.g. `roleId`) result in HTTP 422 validation errors.
- **TC1.3** Invalid email format returns HTTP 422.
- **TC1.4** Database failure triggers HTTP 500 with the error message.

### 2. Delete Invitation Endpoint `/api/v1/invitations/{invitation_id}`
- **TC2.1** Existing invitation ID returns `True` on successful deletion.
- **TC2.2** Non-existent invitation ID returns HTTP 404 `Invitation not found`.
- **TC2.3** Invalid ID format returns HTTP 422.

### 3. Get User Invitations Endpoint `/api/v1/invitations/{email}/email`
- **TC3.1** Valid email with invitations returns a list of invitation objects.
- **TC3.2** Email with no invitations returns an empty list.
- **TC3.3** Invalid email format returns HTTP 422.

### 4. Expiration Handling
- **TC4.1** Invitations older than 7 days are automatically removed from the database.
- **TC4.2** Requests for expired invitations return an empty list.

### 5. Authentication and Permissions
- **TC5.1** All endpoints require authentication; unauthenticated requests return HTTP 401.
- **TC5.2** Ensure that only authorized managers can create or delete invitations for their restaurant.

### 6. Edge Cases
- **TC6.1** Creating multiple invitations with the same email and restaurant is allowed but should update the expiration date.
- **TC6.2** Simulate database connectivity issues and expect HTTP 500 with an appropriate message.
- **TC6.3** Stress test by creating and retrieving a large number of invitations without performance degradation.

These test cases cover standard operations and edge scenarios for the invitation workflow. They can be implemented using `pytest` along with FastAPI's test client to simulate authenticated requests.
